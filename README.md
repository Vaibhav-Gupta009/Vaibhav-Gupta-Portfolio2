Web Dev Unit-1 assignment 2
This code is a simple, well-structured personal portfolio webpage built with HTML and styled externally with CSS. It includes these key parts:

Navigation Bar: A fixed sticky navigation bar at the top with links to About, Skills, Projects, and Contact sections, styled for clear visibility and hover effects.

About Section: Displays a profile image (circle-framed) and a short introduction paragraph about the user.

Skills Section: A bordered and striped table listing skills and their levels, enhancing readability.

Projects Section: Contains two project boxes with titles and descriptions, showcasing beginner projects.

Contact Form: A simple, clean form with labeled inputs for name, class, gender (radio buttons), and email, enabling user interaction and information submission.

Back to Top Button: A fixed button floating at the bottom right, allowing easy smooth scrolling to the top.

Consistent Color Theme & Fonts: The whole webpage uses a professional color palette with blues and whites, along with Google Fonts (Poppins) for modern typography.

CSS Box Model & Positioning: Proper margins, padding, borders, and box shadows improve spacing, aesthetics, and usability. Positioning styles make navigation sticky and the back-to-top button fixed.

Separation with <hr>: Visual dashed lines separate the major sections for clarity and neatness.
